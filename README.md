# Music Project Analysis

This project analyzes music streaming data to compare user preferences between Springfield and Shelbyville, testing hypotheses about user activity based on day of the week and city.

## Objective
Test the hypothesis that user activity differs depending on the day of the week and the city.

## Data
The data is stored in `/datasets/music_project_en.csv` (not included in this repo).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- (Add other libraries used)

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
Open the `music-project.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells.

## Conclusions
- User activity in Springfield is higher on Mondays and Fridays.
- In Shelbyville, Wednesday shows higher activity compared to Monday and Friday, possibly due to weather or events.

## Improvements Suggestions
- Add data visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn.
- Modularize code into functions for better reusability.
- Add unit tests for data processing functions.
- Translate comments and documentation to English for broader accessibility.
- Include the dataset or a sample dataset.
- Add error handling and logging.
- Use environment variables for file paths.
